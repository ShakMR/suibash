# SUIBASH

Execute the command that you like to execute when a command not found is received.
May be is not want you expected anyway :D

## Motivation

This code is an example of laziness at its finest. Sometimes, when I'm working on a terminal
I, by mistake type <strong>cs</strong> instead of <strong>cd</strong>. With this shell hook this problem is solved, at least in
some cases (experimental).

## The code

The code is, in total 91 python and 133 bash lines.

Actually has support for <strong>bash</strong> and <strong>zsh</strong> only. In future
versions more shells will be supported.

## Installation

* Download repository
* execute install.sh (without arguments to see usage) and follow instructions

## Unistallation

* Delete install_folder

or

* Delete the line from .rc file from your shell.
